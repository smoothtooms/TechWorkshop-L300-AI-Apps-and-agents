"""
Agent service: factory + cache for AgentProcessor instances.

Why a factory? Creating an AgentProcessor involves looking up the agent in
Microsoft Foundry and setting up conversation state. This module caches
processors by (agent_type, agent_id) so that repeated requests for the same
agent reuse the existing processor rather than reinitializing each time.

The thread_id is updated on each call because a new WebSocket session may
want to continue with the same agent but on a fresh conversation thread.

Usage in chat_app.py:
    processor = get_or_create_agent_processor(
        agent_id="cora",
        agent_type="cora",
        thread_id=None,
        project_client=project_client,
    )
    async for msg in processor.run_conversation_with_text_stream("Hello"):
        print(msg)
